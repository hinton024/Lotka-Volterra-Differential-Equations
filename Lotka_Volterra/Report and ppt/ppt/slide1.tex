Lotka-Volterra Model: Classical model for interaction of predator
and prey.    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item 
     Alfred Lotka (1920), an American biologist and actuary,
published the mathematical predator-prey model and its
cyclical nature.
        \item  Lotka originated many useful theories of stable populations,
including the logistic model.
        \item Vito Volterra (1925) proposed the same model to explain data
from fish studies of his son-in-law Humberto D'Ancona on the
fishing industry in Italy.
        \item The classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model for the
dynamics of the populations of a predator and its prey species.
